# yalter-bot
A simple Discord bot written in Rust using the [discord-rs](https://github.com/SpaceManiac/discord-rs) library.

This is my "check out / learn Rust" project.

### Usage
The bot expects a file named `token.conf` in the working directory, which contains your Discord bot token.

### Basic commands
- `!modules` - view information about modules and their commands.
- `!commands` - list all available commands.
- `!help <command>` - get help for a given command.
